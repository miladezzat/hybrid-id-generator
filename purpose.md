## Goals:
1. **Uniqueness**: Global uniqueness to avoid collisions.
2. **Scalability**: Works efficiently in distributed systems and centralized databases.
3. **Performance**: Fast for lookups, sorting, and indexing.
4. **Readability**: Optionally human-readable (for URLs or external usage).
5. **Space efficiency**: Minimize storage requirements.
6. **Time-ordering**: Enable chronological sorting when required.
8. **Security**: Avoid revealing sensitive information through ID patterns.

## Proposal: Hybrid ID (Time-based + Random + Sharded)
To design a new type of ID, we can combine several key features from existing ID systems:

- Time component for uniqueness and chronological sorting.
- Random component to avoid sequential patterns and ensure uniqueness across distributed systems.
- Sharded/Machine ID to avoid collisions in a distributed system.
- Compact format to minimize storage, similar to integers.
- Optional human-readable encoding (e.g., base32 or base62) for user-facing applications.

**Here’s how this hybrid ID would look:**
```css
[Timestamp] + [Machine ID] + [Random Component] + [Sequence]
```

1. **Timestamp (42 bits, configurable via `timestampBits`)**
    - **Purpose:** Encodes the current timestamp (in milliseconds by default) for time-based sorting and uniqueness.
    - **Bits required:**
      - 42 bits for milliseconds since Unix epoch (~1 trillion values, enough to store dates for over 139 years).
      - This allows IDs to be ordered chronologically without additional sorting.
    - **Implementation:** Default is wall-clock time (`Date.now()`) for real-world ordering and expiry; optional monotonic time (Node-only) via `useWallClock: false`.

2. **Machine ID (or Shard ID) (10 bits)**
   - **Purpose:** Ensures that IDs generated by different machines or database nodes don’t collide.
   - **Bits required:**
     - **10 bits** for the machine/shard ID allows up to 1024 machines in a distributed system to generate IDs simultaneously.
  
3. **Random Component (8-12 bits)**
   - **Purpose:** Adds randomness to avoid predictable patterns and collisions, especially in systems where multiple IDs may be generated within the same millisecond on the same machine.
   - **Bits required:**
     - **8-12 bits** of randomness ensures low probability of collisions within the same millisecond for IDs generated on the same machine.

4. **Sequence Number (12 bits)**
   - **Purpose:** In cases where a machine generates more than one ID per millisecond, the sequence number ensures uniqueness by incrementing for each additional ID.
   - **Bits required:**
     - **12 bits** allow for 4096 unique IDs to be generated by the same machine within the same millisecond.


Timestamp (48 bits) + Machine ID (12 bits) + Sequence (12 bits) + Random Bits (10 bits) + Entropy Bits (5 bits) = 87 bits total. The entropy bits are populated with random data in the implementation.

### Total Size:
   - `87 bits total` (42 bits timestamp + 10 bits machine ID + 8-12 bits random + 12 bits sequence) is much smaller than a UUID (128 bits) and slightly larger than a 64-bit integer.
   - Compact enough for efficient storage and fast lookups.

## Advantages of the Hybrid ID:
1. **Global Uniqueness**: By combining the timestamp, machine ID, and random/sequence components, collisions are highly unlikely, even in distributed systems.
2. **Efficient Lookups and Indexing**: IDs can be stored and indexed as compact numeric values, making lookups efficient.   
3. **Chronological Ordering**: The timestamp component allows IDs to be naturally ordered by the time they were created.
4. **Scalability**: The machine/shard ID allows distributed systems with many servers or nodes to generate IDs independently.
5. **No Sequential Exposure**: Random components and machine-specific identifiers make it harder for users or competitors to infer system information from ID patterns.
6. **Optional Human-Readable Format**: If needed, the ID can be encoded into a base32 or base62 string format, allowing for human-friendly IDs in URLs or external systems (e.g., `B12K-5P1J`).

### Additional Considerations:
1. **Collision prevention**: Even though collisions are extremely unlikely, if your system generates a large number of IDs very quickly (in the same millisecond), you can extend the random component or use a larger sequence number.
2. **ID Expiry**: Since this ID includes a timestamp, you can also determine when a record was created. This is useful if your system needs to track when resources were created or if you want to implement an expiry system.
3. **Backwards compatibility**: If integrating with existing systems, consider whether you need to convert this ID to a more compact or user-friendly format (e.g., by encoding it in Base62).


### Pros of the Hybrid ID:
- **Globally unique**: Thanks to the combination of time, machine, and randomness.
- **Efficient indexing**: Can be stored compactly as a numeric value.
- **Scalable**: Works well in distributed systems and single-server setups.
- **Time-based**: Useful for time-sensitive queries and natural sorting.
- **Predictable size**: Fixed bit length for consistent storage and performance.
- **Randomization for security**: Prevents inference of data patterns.
  
### Cons:
- **Slightly larger than plain integers**: It takes more bits than a simple integer, though it's still much smaller than a UUID.
- **Requires synchronized clocks**: If the system's clock is not synchronized, it could lead to time discrepancies between different nodes.
- **Complexity in generation**: Slightly more complex than auto-incrementing integers or UUIDs, but this can be abstracted away in an ID generator function.
