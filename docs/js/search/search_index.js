This helps reduce duplicate issues.\nIf no issue exists, create a new issue with the following details:\nDescribe the bug in clear and concise terms.\nProvide steps to reproduce the bug.\nInclude the version of hybrid-id-generator, Node.js, and any other relevant details (e.g., operating system).\nIf possible, include code snippets or a link to a repository demonstrating the issue.\n\n\n\nWe will review your report and aim to respond within a few days.\nRequesting Features\nWe welcome ideas for new features! To request a new feature:\n\nCheck the existing issues and pull requests to ensure it hasn't been suggested or implemented already.\nIf the feature doesn't exist, create a new issue and provide the following details:\nExplain the feature and why it's needed.\nDescribe how it could be implemented, if you have ideas.\nInclude any alternatives or workarounds you've considered.\n\n\n\nOnce submitted, we will evaluate the request and discuss its feasibility.\nSubmitting a Pull Request\nPull requests (PRs) are highly appreciated! To submit a PR:\n\nFork the repository and create your own branch:Example :git checkout -b my-feature-branch\nMake your changes in the new branch. Be sure to follow these guidelines:\n\n\nEnsure your code follows the existing style and structure.\nWrite unit tests for new features or bug fixes.\nRun tests to make sure everything works (npm test).\nIf you're adding a new feature, make sure to update the documentation if necessary.\n\n\nCommit your changes with a meaningful commit message:\n\nExample :git commit -m \"Add a new feature for X\"\nPush to your fork:\n\nExample :git push origin my-feature-branch\nCreate a pull request (PR) to the main branch of the hybrid-id-generator repository.\nIn your PR description, reference any relevant issues (e.g., \"Fixes #123\") and explain your changes.\n\nWe will review your PR, give feedback if necessary, and merge it once it's ready. Please be patient, as this process can take some time depending on the complexity of the change.\nImproving Documentation\nGood documentation is key to a successful project! You can contribute by improving the documentation in the following ways:\n\nFix typos or unclear sections.\nAdd new examples to demonstrate how to use the package.\nImprove the structure of the README or add new guides.\n\nFeel free to submit a PR for any documentation changes.\nCode of Conduct\nThis project follows the Contributor Covenant.

designed to produce unique identifiers by seamlessly combining timestamps, machine identifiers, sequence numbers, and random bits. This innovative approach ensures that each generated ID is unique and highly resilient against collisions, making it ideal for distributed systems.\nThis package is optimized for versatility and can be effortlessly utilized in both client-side and server-side environments, offering flexibility for a wide range of applications—from web development to microservices architecture.\nWhether you are building a high-performance application that requires unique identifiers for database entries or need to track events in real-time, the Hybrid ID Generator provides a reliable solution that meets your needs.\nFeatures\n\nUnique ID Generation: Generates unique IDs based on a combination of timestamp, machine ID, random bits, and sequence number, ensuring uniqueness across different instances.\nBase62 Encoding/Decoding: Supports encoding and decoding of IDs to and from Base62 format, facilitating easier storage and transmission.\nEvent Emission: Emits events upon ID generation, allowing seamless integration with other application components and real-time tracking of ID creation.\nID Expiration Check: Provides functionality to check if an ID has expired based on a specified duration, ensuring IDs are valid only for a predetermined time.\nTimestamp Obfuscation: Offers timestamp obfuscation to enhance security and prevent reverse engineering of ID generation.\nID Validation: Includes methods to validate the format and structure of generated IDs.\nConfiguration Options: Allows customization of parameters such as machine identifiers, sequence numbers, and random bit lengths for flexible use cases.\nCross-Platform Support: Designed to work seamlessly in both client-side and server-side environments, making it versatile for various applications.\n\nInstallation\nYou can install the package via npm:\nExample :npm install hybrid-id-generatorUsage\nImporting the Package\nYou can use the package in both CommonJS and ES Module formats:\nExample :import { HybridIDGenerator } from 'hybrid-id-generator';\n\nconst idGenerator = new HybridIDGenerator({\n    machineId: 1, // Unique identifier for the machine\n    randomBits: 10, // Number of random bits\n});\n\n// Generate a single ID\nconst uniqueId = idGenerator.nextId();\nconsole.log(`Generated ID: ${uniqueId}`);\n\n// Check if an ID is valid\nconst isValid = idGenerator.isHybridID(uniqueId);\nconsole.log(`Is valid ID: ${isValid}`);\n\n// Decode an ID\nconst decodedId = idGenerator.decode(uniqueId);\nconsole.log(`Decoded ID:`, decodedId);Example\nHere’s a quick example of how to use the HybridIDGenerator:\nServer-Side Example\nExample :import { HybridIDGenerator } from 'hybrid-id-generator';\n\n// Initialize the ID generator with a machine identifier and configuration options.\nconst idGenerator = new HybridIDGenerator({\n  sequenceBits: 12,\n  randomBits: 10,\n});\n\n// Generate a new unique ID.\nconst id: number = idGenerator.nextId();\nconsole.log(`Generated ID: ${id}`);Client-Side Example\nExample :import HybridIDGenerator from 'hybrid-id-generator'; // Adjust the path as necessary\n\n// Initialize the ID generator with configuration options.\nconst idGenerator = new HybridIDGenerator({\n  sequenceBits: 12,\n  randomBits: 10,\n  useCrypto: true, // Assuming this option is supported in your implementation\n});\n\n// Generate a new unique ID.\nconst newId: number = idGenerator.nextId();\nconsole.log(`Generated ID: ${newId.toString()}`);API\nHybridIDGenerator API Documentation\nInterfaces\nHybridIDGeneratorOptions\nOptions for configuring the HybridIDGenerator.\n\n\n\nProperty\nType\nDefault\nDescription\n\n\n\n\nsequenceBits\nnumber\n12\nThe number of bits for the sequence component.\n\n\nrandomBits\nnumber\n10\nThe number of bits for the random component.\n\n\nentropyBits\nnumber\n5\nThe number of bits for the entropy component.\n\n\nuseCrypto\nboolean\nfalse\nWhether to use cryptographic functions for random generation.\n\n\nmaskTimestamp\nboolean\nfalse\nWhether to mask the timestamp during ID generation.\n\n\nenableEventEmission\nboolean\nfalse\nWhether to enable event emission for ID generation.\n\n\nmachineIdBits\nnumber\n12\nThe number of bits for the machine ID component.\n\n\nmachineIdStrategy\n`'env'\n'network'\n'random'`\n\n\nmachineId\n`number\nstring`\n-\n\n\n\nHybridIDInfo\nInformation about the generated Hybrid ID.\n\n\n\nProperty\nType\nDescription\n\n\n\n\ntimestamp\nbigint\nThe timestamp portion of the Hybrid ID.\n\n\nmachineId\nnumber\nThe machine ID portion of the Hybrid ID.\n\n\nrandomBits\nnumber\nThe random bits portion of the Hybrid ID.\n\n\nsequence\nnumber\nThe sequence number of the Hybrid ID.\n\n\nmasked\nboolean\nIndicates whether the timestamp is masked.\n\n\n\nClass: HybridIDGenerator\nConstructor\nExample :constructor(options: HybridIDGeneratorOptions = {})Initializes a new instance of HybridIDGenerator with the specified options.\nProperties\n\noptions: HybridIDGeneratorOptions & { sequence: number; lastTimestamp: bigint; maxSequence: number; maxMachineId: number; }\nGets the current options and state of the Hybrid ID generator.\n\n\n\nEvents\nidGenerated\n\nEmitted whenever a new ID is generated. You can listen for this event as follows:\n\nExample :idGenerator.on('idGenerated', (id) => {\n    console.log(`New ID generated: ${id}`);\n});\nidGenerator.nextId();Contributing\nContributions are welcome!
